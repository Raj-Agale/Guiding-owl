Gotcha. Since it’s part of **OwlPath**, we want the resume page to feel smart, goal-focused, and clean—something between a traditional builder and a personalized generator.

Here’s a quick concept for how the **Resume Page** can be structured:

---

### 🧠 OwlPath Resume Builder – Page Layout Idea

#### **🧩 Section 1: User Info Summary (Top Banner)**
- Pulls name, goal, and academic focus directly from user profile (auto-filled)
- Example:  
  `Aarav | Goal: Get into MIT (CS) | Focus: SAT + AI Projects`

---

#### **📄 Section 2: Resume Type Selector**
- Buttons/toggles:  
  - 🎓 *College Resume (for SAT/abroad apps)*  
  - 💼 *Internship/Job Resume*  
  - 📷 *Creative Resume (for photographers/designers)*  
  - 🧑‍💻 *Tech Resume (for coders/projects)*

This sets tone + layout + content style.

#### **✍️ Section 3: Editable Resume Form (Auto + Manual Mix)**
- Each section can be pre-filled based on OwlPath data (editable):
  1. **Contact Info**
  2. **Education**
  3. **Test Scores** (e.g. SAT, JEE)
  4. **Skills**
  5. **Projects** (auto-fetched from planner/goals if possible)
  6. **Extracurriculars** (linked to planner)
  7. **Certifications/Courses**
  8. **Work Experience / Freelance** (optional)
  9. **Achievements / Awards**
  10. **About Me** (short AI-generated paragraph, editable)

---

#### **🤖 Section 4: Smart Resume Generator (AI)**  
- Button: **“Generate using AI”**
- It uses user’s goal, scores, and planner data to:
  - Fill in missing content
  - Rewrite content to sound professional
  - Adapt tone for college vs. internship vs. job

Example:  
_"Built a voice assistant in Python using basic NLP"_  
→ _"Developed a Python-based voice assistant, integrating custom NLP modules for task automation."_

#### **🧾 Section 5: Live Preview + Export**
- Real-time preview of resume on the right (PDF layout style)
- Export options:
  - 📄 Download PDF
  - 🔗 Get shareable link (optional)
  - ☁️ Save to user profile

---

### ⚙️ Bonus Ideas (for future versions)
- Resume “score” or AI feedback ("Too many buzzwords", "Add 1 more project")
- Templates: Clean, Creative, Minimalist, Modern
- Drag and drop to reorder sections

Want me to sketch this in code (React + Tailwind)? Or just help you decide which features to start with?
